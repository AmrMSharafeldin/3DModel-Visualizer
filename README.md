# 3D Model Visualizer using WebGL

### Phase 1: Implemented Interactive Rotation for the Cow Model
   - The model rotates around the X and Y axes in response to mouse drag.
   - Rotation around the Z axis is controlled by the left and right arrow keys.

### Phase 2: Enabled Translation Controls for the Cow Model
   - The model translates in response to mouse drag (similar to the rotation controls).

### Phase 3: Generated and Assigned Per-Vertex Normal Data
   - Normal vectors were calculated for each vertex to enable realistic lighting effects.

### Phase 4: Implemented Phong Lighting
   - Based on [WebGL Fundamentals - 3D Lighting Directional](https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-3d-lighting-directional.html), directional lighting was applied for realistic shading and highlights.

### Phase 5: Refined Color Settings
   - Adjusted color properties of the model to achieve a more natural appearance.
